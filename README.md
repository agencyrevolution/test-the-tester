# test-the-tester
Hello candidate - we're excited to have you apply for our team. We love to move fast and break things. But our customers, they don't like it when we break things. So we're looking to bolster our development process with integrates test automation engineers. A big part of the job will be setting up a testing architecture that scales into the cloud so we can test as much of the platform as possible with scale. We'll be leverating the cloud to make this happen. The candidates will work closely with the engineers in the team and the QA team at large.
